<p>伟大的无产阶级战士，国企老工人的优秀代表，佳士工人声援团发起人之一吴敬堂同志因病医治无效，于2019年1月25日早上5点57分在吉林通化第二人民医院逝世。享年82岁。  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great communist warrior, representative of the old worker in State-owned enterprise, one of sponsor for the Jasic Workers’ Supporting Group, Comrade Wu Jing tang left us forever at the 5:57 am, January 25, 2019 in the 82 years at his life caused by the ineffective treatment due to illness at the Jilin Tonghua Second People's Hospital.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>毛主席说：为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重。吴老毫无私心，为通钢老工人，为中国工人阶级的权益战斗到了生命的最后一刻，他的死是比泰山还重的。这就是我们纪念他，学习他的全部意义。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chairman Mao said “All men must die, but death can vary in its significance, To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather. ” he is not fight for himself but fight for the right of Chinese working class until the last dying breath, his death is weightier than Mount Tai. This is all of significance of we commemorating him and learn from him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2018年7月29日，听闻佳士建会工人被捕的消息后，吴老第一时间发出号召：“奔赴深圳坪山！为了工人阶级的觉醒，为了毛主席！”在吴老和其他同志的发起之下，佳士工人声援团就此成立了，进步学子和社会各界正义人士接过佳士工友的旗帜，继续战斗下去。  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On July 29,2018, after hearing the news of the arrest of the Jasic workers, Wu immediately issued a call: "Go to Pingshan, Shenzhen! For the awakening of the Working Class, for Maoism! " Under the initiative of Wu and other comrades, the Jasic Workers' Supporting Group was formed. Progressive Students and righteous people from all walks of life took over the Jasic workers' banner and continued to fight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>吴老在号召书中写道：“我们是工人阶级，应当是企业的主人，我们的祖国应该是社会主义祖国。可是今天，工人阶级的地位没有了，从我们厂子对比来，从佳士工人们的生活状况，都可以看得出来！”作为中国工人阶级的一员，吴老深知工人同胞的地位变迁，深知工人阶级的权益只能靠自己去争取。在持续9年的通钢护厂运动中，吴老实践着觉悟工人的斗争，并延续到佳士工人斗争，直至生命结束。作为工人阶级的一员、作为马列毛信仰者，为了劳动者的利益而斗争到最后一刻，是死得其所的。 </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We are the working class, we should be the owners of enterprises, and our motherland should be the socialist motherland. But today, the status of the working class has disappeared, as can be seen from the comparison of our factories and from the living conditions of the workers at Jasic." Wu wrote in his call to arms. He was well aware of the changing status of his fellow workers, and of the fact that the rights and interests of the working class could only be fought for by themselves. During the 9-year campaign of protecting Tonggang plant, Wu practiced the struggle of becoming aware of the workers, and continued to the struggle of the Christie's workers until the end of his life. As a member of the working class, as a Marxist-leninist, he have fought for the interests of workers to the last moment, which is a worthy death. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>说吴老没有私心，是因为他曾教导青年人：“革命要先革自己的命。”如果一个人不能革除自己的私心杂念，就不可能像吴老一样，全心全意地为着工人阶级的利益而奋斗。吴老虽然已经去世，但那种敢于自我革命、毫不利己专门利人的精神，是永垂不朽的。 </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is because he once taught young people that "revolution begins with the revolution of oneself. " If one can not rid himself of selfish thoughts, one can not be like Wu to fight wholeheartedly for the interests of the working class. Although he is no longer alive, the spirit of immortality, who dared to revolutionize himself and did nothing for himself but for others, is immortality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>吴老对我们青年一代提供了阶级兄弟般的支持，寄予了同志般的厚望。他说：“我们的下一代、我们的同胞正在觉醒！正在意识到工人阶级的使命，正在走向社会主义！毛主席说，哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗！中国人民是不怕鬼、不信邪的！” </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wu provided our younger generation with class-brotherly support and placed high hopes on our comrades. He said: "Our next generation, our compatriots are awakening!  They are realized the mission of the working class, and moving towards socialism! President Mao said, where there is oppression, there is resistance! The Chinese people are not afraid of ghosts and do not believe in evil spirits!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>今天我们怀着沉重的心情纪念吴老的离世，更要继承吴老的大无畏精神，继承他毫不利己专门利人的精神，接过工人阶级反抗压迫的旗帜，为走向社会主义而斗争到底！</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, with a heavy heart, we commemorate the death of Wu. More importantly, We should inherit Wu Lao's dauntless spirit, and his spirit of no self-interest. Take over the banner of the working class to against oppression, and fight to the end for socialism!</p>
